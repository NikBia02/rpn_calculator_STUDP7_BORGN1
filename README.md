## Projekt : INSERT PROJEKT NAME
### In this file can be found a general description of the project for the rpn calculator described using VHDL 
> For every file you can find which block are included and a short description of what does that block do

## work distribution
### In order to divide the work among us, we as a first step carefully read the task and determined which blocks were needed, after that it proceeded quite "automatically" whenever someone had finished a specific block he would inform the other and inquire about what stage the other was at, in this way it was known what the next block was to be made and one could immediately start.
